# LIMS Product Entry Automation
Dozens of new products are added to LMS monthly, each having a unique ingredient list, testing schedule, and specifications that must be carefully set up in LIMS before samples and results can be added. 
I created automation scripts to consolidate and calculate information across various directories and input the data into LIMS. 
This turned an hour-long undertaking into a simple three-minute task.
